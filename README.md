Readme 

	Mechanoize allows users to input text and sequence a chosen sample, using built in effects and phoneme based formant manipulation to create unique sounds.
These sounds can be used to create a character voice, or to create some interesting audio loops. 

	
Mechanoize is currently at version 1 and is still under agile development. There are a few limitations currently, however these will be fixed in upcoming updates.
 
	
Users must have installed either Max MSP OR have Ableton Live and a version of Max For Live. 
	
Run the application directly in your locked Max patcher window, with presentation mode on.
Choose a sample and a loop point using the open sample file and the slider at the bottom.
Type three words in all caps into the text box and press the Speak button.
Use the coloured buttons on the main section of the control panel to add an effect to a specific phoneme. 

Known bugs:
Audio output is not currently compatible with external DAWs
Typing less than 3 words will cause the sequencer to output the third word of the last input with three words instead of repeating one or two words
Filter selection can cause audio to mute 
Lower case letters not recognised 
Some punctuation is not recognised
 
Future development plans include fixing bugs, allowing for up to ten words to be sequenced, a more descriptive effects control panel, visual indicators to show which phoneme is currently in the sequence, ability to layer more than one sample.
